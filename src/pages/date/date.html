        Have you ever wanted to learn how to play the guitar or piano
        but just couldn't find the time?
        Or maybe you would just rather go out to eat?
        Well, we're not going to teach you how to play an instrument,
        but we can help you have an adventure on your dinner date.

      Speakeasy
    </h2>
    <img src="../assets/photos/speakeasy.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        By 1931 Washington State was home to approximately 4,000 speakeasies.
        Only a few remain. <br>
        True to the speakeasies of the 1920s there are no guarantees that
        you will find the places we will send you to, or that you will get in.
        Watch out for the coppers and if anyone asks where you are going, don't
        say a word. This is one of our hardest dates, so I hope you are
        up for the challenge because it will be one. <br>
        Due to the nature of this date, you will be directed to alternate
        restaurants in case you are not able to gain access.

          Have you ever wanted to go East? How far would you go? Here is
          your chance to experience the East from your own backyard.
          Don't forget your passport or that this is a dinner date,
          so come hungry.

      And baby makes <br>three Central
    </h2>
    <img src="../assets/photos/baby.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        Having a child is an amazing experience. It is truly a blessing. <br>
        It is also amazing how the days fly by and the chances to go out
        are slim to none. Having been in that spot, we set out to find
        some great locations just East of downtown Seattle where you can
        relax with a drink and feel like an adult again, with baby in tow. <br>
        Since this date is designed for parents who are connecting after having
        a child, the focus will be more on sparking conversation rather than
        on exploring different parts of the city.
